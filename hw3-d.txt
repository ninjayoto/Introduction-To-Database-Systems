Since this is the first time I used the DBMS cloud service, it was hard to import the datas I want to use. It was not that hard but kind of complicated which can lead to importing wrong datas. Also, it was running slower than sqlite3 I used before, sqlite, and network was important so that it didn't fail to get query results. However, as I used it, it was useful that it catches errors or gave recommendations that I could use, and gave short explanations about errors what I would do wrong.
